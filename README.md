### Known Errors
If you compile only one Java file and it depends on another, you'll get "class not found" errors. To fix this, compile all related files together:

```bash
javac Main.java BankAccount.java
```

This ensures that the compiler generates `.class` files for all necessary classes. Then you can run your program:

```bash
java Main
```
